LOVABLE PROMPT<BR>
Design a responsive medical dashboard interface for a system called HealthPal, built for doctors to manage their patients, appointments, and medications.

The UI should include:

A login and registration page for doctors

A dashboard that shows:

Overview cards (e.g., total patients, appointments today, medications scheduled)

Navigation sidebar with links: Dashboard, Patients, Appointments, Medications, Logout

A patients view with a list and option to add/edit/delete patients

An appointments view to schedule/manage appointments

A medications view showing medications linked to specific patients with schedule times

Design should follow modern medical aesthetics: clean, light theme, blue/green accents, rounded corners, readable fonts, and simple icons.
